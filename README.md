# Obsidian Project Management Starter Kit for Academic Purposes

This is a personal take on Douani's Obsidian-gtd, adapted for my own
academic purposes. 

# Features

Please read the original description for the explanation of each single
feature, I will list here the new things I have added to it:

-   √ Organisation in folders
-   √ Publications and Teaching added to the kit, complete with their
    own views and nested tags for each.
-   √ Meeting Notes template + Meeting view (have an easy look at all
    your meeting notes)
-   √ Research Folder (still a WIP)

### Required Plugins

-   [Dataview]()
-   [Templater]()

### Recommended Plugins

### Future Plans

-   [ ] Add meetings list for the Project/Publication notes
-   [ ] Experiment with [Auto Note Mover Plugin](), but that would
    require some structure changes.
-   [ ] Once the [Kanban Plugin]() will support a table view, I will try
    to use that one instead of a dataview query for each
    Project/Publication note, leaving the dataview template as an
    option.

> A thousand miles journey is started by taking the first step.

Here is the workflow for me to manage schedule tasks in Obsidian. The
[obsidian-dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/docs/intro)
plugin is required to list projects/actions automatically.

**Project View** ![project view](./images/project-view.png)

-   `N/A` means there is no action in this project.
-   `Blocked` means there is no *Active* action in this project. Telling
    that you shoud put some actions into active state.

**Action View** ![action view](./images/action-view.png)

**A project** ![project](./images/project.png)

**An action** ![action](./images/action.png)

**Archived Projects** ![archived
projects](./images/archived-projects-and-actions.png)

## Features

-   √ Project View: Show all projects in a view.
-   √ Action Views: Show all actions in a view.
-   √ Archive Projects and Actions: Making *Project View* and *Action
    Views* more focusable.
-   √ Tag name customizable: If you don't like the tag below, you can
    rename them!
-   √ Display the progress of action for an program
-   √ Display progress of task for an action

First of all, this is **NOT** a fully implemented GTD system, but a
project management system. It manages your projects, project-related
actions (like "Tasks" in GTD), and simple actions (actions do not belong
to any project.)

    - Project A
        - Project-related Action 1
        - project-related Action 2
    - Project B
        - Project-related Action 3
    - Simple Action 1
    - Simple Action 2

## A project is a markdown file

In this workflow, If an `.md` file with a `#project` tag in it, then
it's a project.

There are also some properties so call [Inline
Fields](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/docs/where-data-comes-from)
that using in a project file.

-   `start_date::`：The date when this project has been started.
-   `end_date::`: The date when this project is finished.
-   `state::`: I use [Obsidian Nested
    tags](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Tag+pane#Nested+tags) to
    manage the states of a project. The available tags are as follows:
    1.  `#project/active`: when this project is active.
    2.  `#project/archived`: when this project has been finished and It
        was no need to be display, I marked this tag to this project.

## A action is also a markdown file

Defferent from a task `- [ ]` in the `.md` file, an "action" is also an
`.md` file, with a `#action` tag in it.

An action also contains some inline fields:

-   `project::`: If an action contains this inline field, it's an
    project-related action. The value of this field *SHOULD* be an
    [Internal link](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Internal+link) to
    the project. If the value is not given, then this is a simple
    action.
-   `due_date::`: The due date of this action.
-   `start_date::`: The date when this action has been started.
-   `end_date::`: The date when this action is finished.
-   `priority::`: A \> B \> C, or 1 \> 2 \> 3.
-   `state::`: Just like the `state` field in a project, all action
    states are as follows:
    1.  `#action/active`: when this action is active, hard working to
        deal it.
    2.  `#action/waiting`: when this action relies on other action or
        relies on somebody's response, I mark this action into this
        state.
    3.  `#action/done`: when this action is finished, mark this action
        into this state, and update the `end_date`.
    4.  `#action/canceled`: when this action has been finished.
    5.  `#action/maybe`: Actions that you may do in somedays.
    6.  `#action/archived`: when this action has been finished and It
        was no need to be display, I marked this tag to this action. I
        usually do this for the Single Actions.

## Priority

A \> B \> C \> D ..., or 1 \> 2 \> 3 \> 4 ... (using default sort
method) is ok!

## About dataviewjs

I use `dataviewsjs` blocks instead of `dataview` blocks because I can
write Javascript code inside a `dataviewsjs` block and it can do much
complex work than Dataview Query Language. For example, I can join two
table using JS, but the JOIN statement hasn't implemented in DQL yet.

I put all my JS code into `/tools/dv-script/` folder, and they are all
`*.js` files. There are some advantages:

1.  I can use VSCode to write code (VSCode).
2.  Better for code reusing.
3.  Letting `dataviewsjs` block take up less space than writting all the
    raw code in the block. For example, to show the project view, I just
    need to write 2 line: ![](./images/block-example.png)

Thanks for the awesome plugin
